## Introduction
Grafana is a popular open-source platform used to visualize and analyze metrics. It supports multiple data sources like Prometheus, InfluxDB, Elasticsearch, and many others.

## Installing Grafana
Grafana can be installed on various platforms. The [official installation guide](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/) provides detailed instructions. Grafana can run on Linux, Windows, macOS, and as a Docker container.

## Basic Concepts
- **Dashboard**: A collection of panels in a single view.
- **Panel**: A single block within a dashboard that can show graphs, tables, stats, maps, and more.
- **Data Source**: The source of your data (e.g., Prometheus, SQL databases).

## Adding Data Sources
1. Open Grafana and navigate to **Configuration > Data Sources**.
2. Click **Add data source**.
3. Choose your data source (e.g., Prometheus).
4. Configure the data source settings (URL, access settings).
5. Save and test the data source.

## Creating Dashboards
- Navigate to the dashboard view and click **Create Dashboard**.
- Start adding panels to the dashboard and configure them according to your data.

## Basic Panels
- **Graph Panel**: For time series data visualization.
- **Table Panel**: To display data in a tabular format.


## Alerting in Grafana
- Create alerts on panels to get notified about threshold breaches.
- Configure notification channels like email, Slack, or webhooks.
