Azure Load Balancer interview questions with answers

1. What is Azure Load Balancer, and what is its primary purpose?

Answer: Azure Load Balancer is a load balancing service that distributes incoming network traffic across multiple virtual machines or instances to ensure high availability and reliability of applications. Its primary purpose is to improve the availability and fault tolerance of applications by evenly distributing traffic and ensuring that it is directed to healthy instances.

2. Can you explain the difference between Azure Standard Load Balancer and Azure Basic Load Balancer?

Answer: Azure Standard Load Balancer offers more advanced features and capabilities compared to Azure Basic Load Balancer. Standard Load Balancer provides support for multiple backend pools, outbound connections, and more granular load-balancing rules. It is suitable for complex application architectures. Azure Basic Load Balancer, on the other hand, is a simplified load balancer for basic scenarios and offers fewer features.

3. How does Azure Load Balancer distribute traffic among backend resources?

Answer: Azure Load Balancer uses a hashing algorithm based on source IP and port to distribute incoming traffic evenly across the available backend resources. This ensures that each backend resource receives a fair share of the incoming requests, promoting load balancing.

4. What is the health probe in Azure Load Balancer, and why is it important?

Answer: A health probe is a mechanism used by Azure Load Balancer to periodically check the health of backend resources. It sends probes (usually TCP or HTTP requests) to each backend instance and marks them as healthy or unhealthy based on their responses. This is crucial for ensuring that traffic is only directed to healthy instances, improving application reliability.

5. Describe the key components of an Azure Load Balancer configuration.

Answer: The key components of an Azure Load Balancer configuration include:

Frontend IP Configuration: Defines how external traffic is received.
Backend Address Pool: Specifies the set of backend resources (virtual machines or instances) to distribute traffic to.
Load Balancing Rules: Define how traffic is distributed based on protocols and ports.
Inbound NAT Rules (optional): Map incoming traffic to specific backend resources using Network Address Translation.
Health Probes: Define how the load balancer checks the health of backend resources.
Outbound Rules (for Standard Load Balancer): Configure how outbound traffic from backend resources is handled.
Network Security Groups (NSGs): Optionally, apply network security rules for controlling traffic to and from the load balancer.
6. Walk me through the steps to create an Azure Load Balancer.

Answer: The steps to create an Azure Load Balancer typically involve the following:

Create a resource group if one doesn't already exist.
Create a public IP address or allocate an IP address for the frontend configuration.
Create a backend pool and add virtual machines or instances to it.
Configure load balancing rules to define how traffic is distributed.
Define health probes to monitor the health of backend resources.
Optionally, configure inbound NAT rules or outbound rules (for Standard Load Balancer).
Review and create the Load Balancer resource.
7. How does Azure Load Balancer contribute to high availability in an application architecture?

Answer: Azure Load Balancer distributes traffic across multiple backend resources. In the event of a failure of one backend resource, traffic is automatically redirected to healthy instances, ensuring continuous service availability. By using Azure Availability Sets or Availability Zones in conjunction with Azure Load Balancer, you can further enhance the availability of your applications.

8. What tools and techniques can you use to troubleshoot issues with Azure Load Balancer?

Answer: Troubleshooting Azure Load Balancer issues can involve:

Monitoring load balancer health probe status.
Checking network security group rules for proper configuration.
Examining backend instance health and connectivity.
Analyzing traffic flow and logs.
Using Azure Monitor and Azure Network Watcher for diagnostics.
9. How can you restrict access to an Azure Load Balancer to only specific IP ranges or networks?

Answer: You can restrict access to an Azure Load Balancer by configuring network security group (NSG) rules. In the NSG associated with the backend resources, you can define inbound and outbound rules to allow or deny traffic based on source IP addresses, protocols, and ports. This allows you to restrict access to only authorized IP ranges or networks.

10. How do you monitor the performance and health of Azure Load Balancer? What metrics can you track?

Answer: Azure Load Balancer can be monitored using Azure Monitor, which provides various metrics and logs for tracking performance and health. Some key metrics include:

Data Path Availability: Measures the percentage of time the load balancer is available.
Data Path Health Probe Status: Tracks the health of backend resources.
Throughput and Data Path Latency: Monitors data flow through the load balancer.
Data Path Outbound Health Probe Status (for Standard Load Balancer): Monitors outbound health probe status.
