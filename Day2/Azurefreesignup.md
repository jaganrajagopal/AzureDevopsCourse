Microsoft will send you a verification code to the email address you provided. Go to your email inbox, find the email from Microsoft, and click the link or enter the verification code to confirm your email address.

Step 6: Set Up Security Information

You will be prompted to add security information such as a phone number. This helps secure your account and can be used for account recovery if needed.

Step 7: Agree to the Terms

Read through Microsoft's Terms of Service and Privacy Statement. If you agree to them, check the box and click "Next."

Step 8: Provide Payment Information (Optional)

Azure may require you to provide payment information, such as a credit card, for identity verification purposes. However, you won't be charged during the free trial period unless you upgrade to a paid plan.

Step 9: Verify Your Identity

Microsoft may ask for additional verification of your identity. This can include a text message code or a phone call with a verification code. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete this step.

Step 10: Start Using Your Azure Free Account

Once your account is created and verified, you can start using your Azure free account. You'll have access to a range of Azure services with limited free credits each month. Be sure to monitor your usage to avoid exceeding the free credits.

That's it! You've successfully signed up for a free Azure account. You can now explore and use Azure services for your projects and applications within the free tier limits. Remember to keep an eye on your usage to avoid unexpected charges if you decide to upgrade to a paid plan or exceed the free tier limits.
